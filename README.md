- **Real-time Communication**: Chrome runtime messaging between popup and content script
- **Content Injection**: Sequential insertion of parsed sections with proper formatting and timing

## Supported Pages

## Development Status

**Currently Working:**

- ✅ Advanced formatting support (headings, quotes, code blocks, lists, tables, images)
- ✅ File upload and preview functionality
- ✅ Automatic Medium formatting application via keyboard shortcuts

**Technical Features:**

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **Medium-Specific**: Designed specifically for Medium.com and may not work on other platforms

## File Support

- ✅ `.md` files (Markdown)
- ✅ `.markdown` files (Markdown)
- ✅ `.txt` files (Plain text with markdown syntax)
- 📏 Maximum file size: 5MB

## Medium Keyboard Shortcuts Used

The extension automatically applies these Medium keyboard shortcuts during content insertion:

| Element | macOS | Windows | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Header (H1) | `Cmd+Opt+1` | `Ctrl+Alt+1` | Large header |
| Subheader (H2-H6) | `Cmd+Opt+2` | `Ctrl+Alt+2` | Medium header |
| Quote | `Cmd+Opt+5` | `Ctrl+Alt+5` | Blockquote formatting |
| Code Block | `Cmd+Opt+6` | `Ctrl+Alt+6` | Code block with syntax highlighting |

## Example Usage

1. **Create a markdown file** (`example.md`):
